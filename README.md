# ECE3301-Lecture-Project
Contactless Temperature Sensor using MLX90614 and OLED Display on ESP8266

The goal of this project was to create a functioning contactless thermometer with IoT capabilities. This was accomplished through the use of an ESP8266 Microcontroller interfaced with an MLX90614 and a 0.96" OLED display. The ESP8266 receives the data from the MLX90614 sensor and converts it into a meaningful form and displays this data onto the OLED display for the user to immediately access. The microcontroller creates a connection to a Blynk.io application on power-on and allows the user to access the data from the MCU remotely provided the device has a stable internet connection.
